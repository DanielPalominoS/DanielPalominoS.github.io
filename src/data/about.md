# Intro

A passionate MSc. in Electronic engineering who loves technology.

I possess more than three years of experience developing robotics solutions (including both aerial and ground). Strengthen Agriculture has been the focus of the majority of the projects I have worked on. 

I have been involved across multiple stages including hardware analysis, integration and deployment as well as software development. The selection of sensors, processing systems (PCs, SBCs and embed systems), actuators is part of the analysis process I have worked on, as well as the testing and integration between them. 

In the software related tasks, I have been involved in the generation of mobile applications, web interfaces and more importantly the development of specific software and firmware to control the behavior of the robots depending on the goal to achieve. I have worked using languages such as C++, Python, Java and JavaScript, while working with frameworks like ROS, PX4, Ardupilot Vue JS. And finally, I also have knowledge in areas such as Machine learning, Photogrammetry and Computer vision. I domain their basic concepts and have experience using tools that allow to implement solutions using such knowledge (algorithms, libraries, architectures, etc). 

I also have more than two years of teaching experience. In this case, the teaching experience has been focused in basic electronics concepts and applications.
